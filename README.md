The Library Management System is a piece of 
software that, as its name suggests, manages 
all of the data associated with the library. 
Instead of writing the information down in a 
notebook, it makes the task of the librarian 
simpler. In the past, librarians would keep 
track of volumes using notebooks, where they 
would make additions, deletions, do searches, 
and a whole lot more. 
This was a laborious and time-consuming 
task. As a result, various software programmes 
were produced in order to make this process 
easier. Today, I have built a comparable project 
based on my understanding using the 
programming language C. 

FEATURES 
1. Add New Book: 
By inputting information such book ID, title, 
author, genre, and quantity, users may add 
new books to the library. A comma-separated 
values (.csv) file houses the data. 
 
2. Search Books: 
Users may do a search for books using criteria 
such as title, author, and genre. Information 
relevant to the search is shown alongside the 
results. 
 
3.Display All Books: 
The software provides an option to view a 
table displaying all available books in the 
library, including their book ID, title, author, 
genre, and quantity. 
 
4.Check Availability: 
Users may find out whether a certain book is 
available at a library by entering the book's 
identification number (book ID). When a user 
6
requests a book, the system checks its 
availability and displays the results to them. 
 
5.Book Check-Out/Return: 
Users may check out and return books by 
entering the book's identification number. The 
number of books that are now available has 
been updated by the system. 
 
6.Delete Book: 
By entering the book's ID, administrators may 
remove it from the library's collection. The 
chosen book's information is deleted from the 
system's database. 
 
7.Exit: 
This allows the user to exit/terminate/quit the 
program.
